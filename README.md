# OPPO-hackathon

Brainstorming: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UQ54qj7YiUUd6jlZa81AOSKcVg2hRyhCa6rYT8OI1v0/edit?usp=sharing

## Problem Statement
Sometimes we fall asleep at odd times, without finishing a nightly routine, or otherwise not being in the ideal environment for a good night's sleep. We want to create a better sleeping environment for users that is easy to use and can be customized to their needs.

## Solution
Using the OPPO Watch Live's sleep-tracking capabilities, combined with an OPPO Wireless router and smart phone, we can control the smart devices in the home to fit a user's sleeping needs. Once the Watch detects the user is asleep, it can set in motion certain actions to prepare the home for a good night's sleep. For example, the lights can be dimmed, the TV can be turned off, and the temperature can be adjusted to a comfortable level. The user can also set up a routine that will be triggered when the user wakes up. For example, the lights can be turned on and the temperature can be adjusted to a comfortable level.
